Maxim Titley is currently our professor for the class Object-Oriented Programming in which three of us are enrolled in. He has also taught some of us for the Design and Implementation I class for the Spring 2017 semester. Other than that, we have no affiliations.  

### General Problem:

The use of data structures when implementing ideas by writing code is a huge benefit to programmers. All programmers import different libraries to use various data structures to avoid writing their own implementations. Professor Titley has proposed the idea of implementing skip lists and skip graphs and claims he has not seen an implementaion of skip graphs in any language which means there are few to no implementations. Skip graphs are a tree structure based on skip lists. which have better insertion and deletion times than linked lists. Skip graphs are useful for searching in P2P networks which are highly useful as users can share files without the use of a server.  

### Proposed Solution:

We propose to implement skip lists in Scala. This will be done by first implementing the Node class. After we are finished with the Node class, we will implement the skip lists themselves. If time permits and we believe we have a better understanding of skip lists and the Scala programming language, then we will attempt skip graphs.
